- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- milify - A javascript library used in formating numbers
- [moment](https://momentjs.com/) - working with dateTime
- [Rapid Api](https://rapidapi.com/) - The main API providing information about cryptos
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - fetching data
- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - managing states and data


### What I learned
This project is such a great project where I learnt so many new things and added more knowledge to knowledge I have before. Ant Design was the main design system used in developing this app with  css modules. 
millify which is a javscript library used in formating numbers. the likes of numbes like 2000, 2500 will be formated to 2k 2.5k.
moment.js momemnt is literally working with DateTime values, head over to their website to explore more about moment
Rapid Api is basically the core API used in build this project. Rapid Api offers countless API in their web address. They offers informations on cryptocurrecny, life style and all that you cant even think off. I used the Bing search API including the cryptocurrecy API for this project
Redux toolkit is a state management library used in managing states or data between web applications. The redux toolkit came with mad functionalities to replace the already existing native redux managing state. Redux toolkit is even recommended by the redux teams to use because it is fast and more modernizws.
